# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a Flutter app with platform wrappers and shared packages.
- `lib/` holds the Dart source for the Ensu app.
- `assets/` and `fonts/` contain bundled images, icons, and fonts.
- `test/` and `integration_test/` contain unit and integration tests.
- `android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `linux/`, `windows/`, `web/` are platform shells.
- `rust/` and `rust_builder/` house Rust components and build tooling.
- `build/` is generated by Flutter; avoid manual edits.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use Flutter 3.32.8 and initialize submodules first.
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`: fetch nested dependencies.
- `dart pub global activate melos` then `melos bootstrap`: install workspace deps.
- `flutter pub get`: fetch app dependencies (if not using Melos).
- `flutter run -t lib/main.dart --flavor independent`: run Android locally.
- `flutter run`: run iOS locally.
- `flutter build apk --release --flavor independent`: Android release build.
- `flutter build ios`: iOS release build.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow Dart and Flutter conventions and lint rules in `analysis_options.yaml`.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; wrap long lines where readability improves.
- Files: `snake_case.dart`; classes `UpperCamelCase`; variables `lowerCamelCase`.
- Format with `dart format .` or your IDE Flutter formatter before commits.

## Testing Guidelines
Tests use Flutter’s built-in testing libraries.
- Unit tests live in `test/` and follow `*_test.dart` naming.
- Integration tests live in `integration_test/`.
- Run unit tests with `flutter test`.
- Run integration tests with `flutter test integration_test`.
No explicit coverage threshold is documented; add tests for new logic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Keep commit messages imperative and concise.
For PRs, include:
- A clear description and linked issue (if any).
- Test results (`flutter test`, device run, or build output).
- Screenshots or recordings for UI changes.

## Configuration Notes
`pubspec.yaml` includes path-based dependencies (for example `fllama`); update
paths to match your local environment if needed.
