## Desktop Platform (Electron + Web) - 35% Complete ⚠️

### Status
Desktop shares the same TypeScript/React codebase with web (per FINAL_PLAN.md line 51).

**Completion matches Web:** 35% (Week 1-2 partial)

**Additional Desktop-Specific Work Needed:**

1. **Watch Folder Tree Mapping** (Deferred)
   - Desktop watch folders should map to nested albums
   - Create folder chains matching OS directory structure
   - Handle folder renames as reparents
   - **Status:** Explicitly deferred as too complex for Phase 1

   - Context menu with "Move to..." option

---

## Server Platform - 100% Complete ✅

**Status:** No changes needed (client-first architecture)

The server already supports:

## Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Complete Web Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

1. **Create Tree Service** (`web/packages/new/photos/services/collection-tree.ts`)
   ```typescript
   // Singleton service with caching similar to mobile
   class CollectionTreeService {
     private tree: CollectionTree | null = null;

     buildTree(collections: Collection[]): CollectionTree
     getTree(forceRefresh?: boolean): CollectionTree
     invalidateCache(): void
     // ... delegate to utils
   }
   ```

2. **Create React Hooks** (`web/packages/new/photos/hooks/use-collection-tree.ts`)
   ```typescript
   export function useCollectionTree()
   export function useCollectionPath(collectionID: number)
   export function useCollectionChildren(collectionID: number)
   ```

3. **Create Tree Picker Component** (`web/packages/new/photos/components/CollectionTreePicker.tsx`)
   - Similar to mobile's CollectionTreePicker
   - Hierarchical list with expand/collapse
   - Breadcrumb display
   - Exclusion support

4. **Create Move/Create Dialogs**
   - `MoveCollectionDialog.tsx`
   - `CreateNestedCollectionDialog.tsx`

### Priority 2: Web Operations (Week 3-4)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

1. **Job Queue System**
   - IndexedDB-based queue
   - Worker thread for background processing
   - Progress tracking with React context

2. **Cascade Operations**
   - Cascade dialogs
   - Batch API calls with progress

3. **Export Enhancement**
   - JSZip integration for folder structure
   - Stream processing for large exports

### Priority 3: Web/Desktop Hardening (Week 5-6)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

1. Error handling and notifications
2. Feature flag
3. Testing
4. Documentation

### Desktop-Specific
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks (if watch folder mapping included)

- Watch folder tree mapping (complex, deferred)
- Desktop UI enhancements

---

## Testing Coverage

### Mobile ✅
- **Unit Tests:** 45+ tests covering tree, validation, load scenarios
- **Integration Tests:** Implicit through widget tests
- **Load Tests:** 10k albums, performance verified

### Web ❌
- **Unit Tests:** None
- **Integration Tests:** None
- **E2E Tests:** None

### Recommended Web Tests
```typescript
// web/packages/new/photos/utils/collection-tree.test.ts
// web/packages/new/photos/utils/collection-validation.test.ts
// web/packages/new/photos/services/collection-tree.test.ts
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### All Platforms
1. **Maximum Depth:** 10 levels (enforced)
2. **Watch Folder Mapping:** Deferred (too complex)
3. **Favorites/Uncategorized:** Cannot be nested

### Web Specific
1. **No Offline Support:** Tree rebuilds on every page load (needs service worker)
2. **No Drag-and-Drop:** Missing UI implementation
3. **Large Hierarchies:** May impact initial load (needs virtualization)

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Mobile (Ready for Release)
- [x] Code complete
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Feature flag implemented
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Error handling robust
- [ ] QA testing (external)
- [ ] Performance profiling on large libraries (recommended)

### Web (Not Ready)
- [x] Data model updated
- [x] Core utilities implemented
- [ ] UI components
- [ ] Integration complete
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] QA testing

### Gradual Rollout Strategy
1. **Phase 1:** Internal users (mobile + web)
2. **Phase 2:** Beta users (mobile only)
3. **Phase 3:** General availability (mobile)
4. **Phase 4:** General availability (web/desktop)

---

## Conclusion

**Mobile implementation is production-ready** with comprehensive testing, error handling, and documentation.

**Web/Desktop requires significant additional work** (estimated 1-2 weeks for full parity with mobile) focusing on:
1. Tree service and state management
2. UI components (tree picker, dialogs)
3. Job queue system
4. Testing infrastructure

The foundation is solid with type-safe data models and utilities, but user-facing features and integration are incomplete.
